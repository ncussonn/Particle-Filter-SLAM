# Particle-Filter-SLAM

Particle filter used for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) of a car driving a circuit around a city. Written in Python for a school project in ECE-276A at UC San Diego. Project was not complete in it's entirety due to time constraints but SLAM principles illustrated in code and in report.
